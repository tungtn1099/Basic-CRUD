2. Run SQLQuery2.sql to create the whole database (sorry I ran some tests so it looks really scuffed)
3. Starts the project from Controller.ListController or localhost:(port)/CRUD_Students_Departments/student/list

I will try to add comments when I'm done with the permissions and departments updates :D

This was done on Windows 10 22H2; Opera GX Browser; Apache NetBeans 13 with TomCat 10.0 and JDK 1.8; JDBC 4.2 and JSTL 2.0.0; and SSMS 19.
